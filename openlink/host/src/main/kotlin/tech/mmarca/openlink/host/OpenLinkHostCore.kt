 * - an unknown caller becomes PENDING with what it asked for, and gets nothing;
 * - a caller signed by a known signer is TRUSTED for what it asked for, without a prompt;
 * - a known package with another signer drops back to PENDING, its grants cleared;
 * - BLOCKED stays blocked until the user forgets the app;
 * - a capability the caller never asked for is never granted.
 *
 * Changes are published on [clients], which the host app's UI (the pending card, the
 * connected-apps screen) observes, and passed to [onTrustChanged], which the binder layer
 * uses to tell the client and to end what a revoked capability covered.
